# Boston House Price Predictor

An interactive machine learning application that predicts house prices based on the Boston Housing dataset. This project features a Ridge regression model with polynomial features and a dark-mode graphical user interface (GUI) built using Tkinter.

## Features
- Preprocessed the Boston Housing dataset using `StandardScaler` and polynomial transformations.
- Ridge regression model for predictions.
- GUI with a user-friendly dark mode theme for entering feature values and visualizing results.
- Displays model performance metrics (MSE, RÂ², Cross-Validated MSE).

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
  - Libraries: `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `numpy`, `tkinter`
- **Machine Learning**
  - Ridge Regression
  - Polynomial Features
- **GUI**
  - Tkinter for a desktop-based interactive application
